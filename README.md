# Coinfluence: The Role of Currency Numerosity in Consumer Decision Making

**A behavioral economics research paper on the role of the face value of a foreign currency in affecting a consumers' willingness to pay**

## Abstract

Research into the effect of using foreign currencies on consumption behaviour suggests that consumers systematically under- or overspend based on the nominal (face) value of the foreign currency. However, previous research is undecided on which direction this effect has, with the two most prominent models leading to different and mutually exclusive outcomes. This paper considers the different models and tests their predictive and explanatory accuracy using a study. It finds that individuals tend to underspend when the foreign currency is less numerous than (a fraction of) the home currency and overspend when the opposite is the case. The paper discusses which model is most accurate at predicting and explaining this effect and considers limitations as well as opportunities for future research.
