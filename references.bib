    abstract = "{Money illusion research shows that the nominal (face) value of money affects consumer perceptions of its real value. Recent mixed findings on consumer valuations in different currencies suggest that the underlying anchoring and adjustment processes are complex. We develop a framework to identify boundary conditions that specify the direction of anchoring effects on valuations in different currencies. Consumers anchor on the numerosity of the nominal difference between prices and salient referents (e.g., budgets) when evaluating transactions. Support for our framework comes from a series of experiments that evoke different reference standards. We discuss implications and opportunities for future research.}",

    abstract = "{This article examines systematic differences in people's spending behavior when using foreign currencies. Rather than overspend or underspend in general, we show that individuals' valuation of a product in an unfamiliar foreign currency is biased toward its nominal value—its face value—with inadequate adjustment for the exchange rate. This leads to underspending when the face value of a foreign currency is a multiple of an equivalent unit of a home currency (e.g., 4 Malaysian ringgits = 1 U.S. dollar) and overspending when it is a fraction (e.g., .4 Bahraini dinar = 1 U.S. dollar). Four studies demonstrate the robustness of the face value effect across different currencies, exchange rate frames, and with samples from two countries, and two studies show that ability-related factors such as time pressure and experience moderate the face value effect. The article concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of the findings.}",

    abstract={Although people routinely estimate the value of items in their environment, from goods and services to natural resources and lost earnings following an accident, the processes that underlie human valuation estimates are not well understood. We show that people use familiarity and fluency---the ease with which they process information---to determine an item's value. In three experiments, participants believed that familiar forms of currency (e.g., a familiar {\$}1 bill) had greater purchasing power than their unfamiliar counterparts (e.g., a rare and unfamiliar coin). Mechanistic analyses showed a positive correlation between participants' familiarity with the unfamiliar currency and their estimates of its value. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our findings for researchers, marketing experts, and policymakers alike.},

 abstract = {The term "money illusion" refers to a tendency to think in terms of nominal rather than real monetary values. Money illusion has significant implications for economic theory, yet it implies a lack of rationality that is alien to economists. This paper reviews survey questions regarding people's reactions to variations in inflation and prices, designed to shed light on the psychology that underlies money illusion. We propose that people often think about economic transactions in both nominal and real terms, and that money illusion arises from an interaction between these representations, which results in a bias toward a nominal evaluation.},

abstract = {Researchers frequently use variants of the Becker–DeGroot–Marschak (BDM) mechanism to elicit willingness to pay (WTP). These variants involve numerous incentive-irrelevant design choices, some of which carry advantages for implementation but may deteriorate participant comprehension or trust in the mechanism, which are well-known problems with the BDM. We highlight three such features and test them in the field in rural Uganda, a relevant population for many recent applications. Comprehension is very high, and 86 percent of participants bid optimally for an induced-value voucher, with little variation across treatments. This gives confidence for similar applications, and suggests the comprehension-expediency trade-off is mild.}

abstract = {We compare the capability of the Becker–DeGroot–Marschak (BDM) mechanism and the Vickrey auction to reveal willingness-to-pay information for a sample of French consumers. We measure the bias and dispersion of bids relative to valuations. We find that the Vickrey auction, for the particular training procedure we employ, is more effective as a willingness-to-pay elicitation device than the BDM process. We conjecture that differences in the shape of the payoff function account for some of the differences.}
